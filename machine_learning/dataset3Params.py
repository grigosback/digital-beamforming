    # EX6PARAMS returns your choice of C and sigma for Part 3 of the exercise
    # where you select the optimal (C, sigma) learning parameters to use for SVM

    #   [C, sigma] = EX6PARAMS(X, y, Xval, yval) returns your choice of C and

    # ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
    # Instructions: Fill in this function to return the optimal C and sigma
    #               learning parameters found using the cross validation set.
    #               You can use svmPredict to predict the labels on the cross
    #               validation set. For example,
    #                   predictions = svmPredict(model, Xval)
    #               will return the predictions on the cross validation set.
    #
    #  Note: You can compute the prediction error using
    #        mean(double(predictions ~= yval))
